# AA-PythonKDTree
This was an assignment I completed in collaboration with a friend at Uni to create a kd-tree using python. Unfortunately, I was convinced to not use version control so there's no commit log.
The code that we wrote is contained in `nearestNeigh/naive_nn.py` and `nearestNeigh/kd_tree_nn.py`
